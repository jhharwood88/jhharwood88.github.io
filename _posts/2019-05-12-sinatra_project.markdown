    For my project i chose to make a site for recipe storage. I first started by mapping out my program, creating the neccisary file structure and creating my migrations that would become the data for my project. After setting up my file structure I began on my user class, the has_many side of the relationship. I created routes for handing new users and then returning users, making sure that i could relate the current session to the apropriate user. 
		
		Next was creating the user, it was time to make the recipes that belonged to that user. I found it usefull to create some dummy data to seed my database, and after that it was just a matter of creating forms for making more recipes, then i moved onto editing and deleting. 
		
		I found it usefull to break it up into smaller sections, making sure that my read and create functions were solid before moving onto editing and deleting. I also found that laying out my day and what i wanted to get accomplished that day was helpful rather than just working for a set amount of time and doing as much as i could all at once. By splitting things up into days the project felt signifigantly more managed than my previous project making the CLI.
