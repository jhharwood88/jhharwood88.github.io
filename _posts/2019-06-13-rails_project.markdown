For my rails project i did a shopping list creator. This was an interesting project, it was cool to be able to see more functionality in my project compared to the previous Sinatra project. I had some struggles early on in using the nested routes, eventually adding a 4th table to as my join between my List and Items. I was able to use the devise generated user methods to assign the list to a user, and through associations assign items to a item list which was created through my users list index assigning any lists created by that logged in user to their specific user ID. Having 4 tables caused some logical issues of how exactly to generate items to a list but i was able to build out a form where a user would create an item list by entering in the item id and it would associate it with the current working list. Despite the complications I enjoyed this project a good bit, from the struggle to the success.
