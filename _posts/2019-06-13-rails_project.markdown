For my rails project i did a shopping list creator. This was an interesting project, it was cool to be able to see more functionality in my project compared to the previous sinatra proeject. I did have some major issues with the Omniauth requirement, mainly that it was incredibly hard to use considering facebook was not possible due to changes in how they worked making the previous lab not compatibale for an example. I have as of this moment still not been able to get omniauth to properly work, and having no real idea how it was supposed to work in the first place i will be submitting it broken. If i do end up fixing it, i will come back and update this accordingly. The project was intersesting but mostly just frustrating, given i had used devise to set up my login user function and not being completely comfortable with how some of the devise functions worked. All in all i am seriously looking forward to finsihing this project and moving forward.
