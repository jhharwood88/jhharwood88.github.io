In this blog post I will be covering some tips and tricks I have found to help in being a successful technical interview candidate and how to improvise on some of the more difficult questions that may arise in response to you're technical answers. 

One of the more challenging questions that may be presented to you during your technical interview would be to describe a project or application you have developed and why that project stood out to you in comparison to other work you have been doing. This is an important question to consider because it lets potential employers know where not only your strengths lie but where your interests will be pointing you in your future career as a developer. This is a good one to prepare for, including keeping a fresh example of the project and any additional features you have developed since its original inception. Being able to describe not only the function but the logic behind why and how you came to these conclusions will allow the technical interviewer to get a better grasp on your cognitive processes and asses if that is something that would fit into their development style. 

Another question that has thrown me off personally is to describe a recent problem and how exactly you went about solving it. This can be a difficult question as it has both the potential to help you in regards to showing off your problem solving and technical aptitude but it can also present an issue if the problem you chose seems to be to simple or if it was simple and caused you to struggle. While this is not always a tried and true method to test an individual's problem solving and testing capabilities it can be important to be able to fluently and intelligently describe the problem and how you came about your solution. 

The final question I will be covering is when your asked to describe what you like most about programming. This can be a tricky question and generally needs to be answered with care as it goes into lengths to discern if your personal ambitions align with what the recruiter is looking for in their specific role to be filled. Its important to be honest and personal when describing your passion as an ingenuine answer may be off putting or seem insincere. These are not only technical questions but have an impact on how you are viewed as a developer in regards to fitting into a group dynamic when it comes to problem solving and collaboration.

While there are many other questions that can come up during interviews, these specific ones have been asked of me more often than not and I generally found them to be the most profound and non generic as they directly relate to the job in question and even more so how your answers fit into their current culture.
