  First off i would like to take the time to say that this has been an amazing journey, and this project was a nice way to wrap things up in the journey from back end to front end development. Throughout this whole course I have slowly been seeing the bigger picture develop, from the early beginings of Ruby and interacting with a database using SQLite, to building out our own user interface with Rails and improving upon it with JS. Now to come full circle and have our Ruby back end working with our React/Redux front end has been a really cool experience. 
	
	As with most of the projects I have completed throughout this course I came in with a sense of trepedation, not feeling nearly as secure in my understanding as I had with previous materials/projects. While i can say im still not entirely sure im 100% on Redux, this project has helped me considerably to make progress in my understanding not only of how, but why. 
	
	I think that all in all this has been one of my more enjoyable projects, given it has the closest resembalance to a real world application that I have gotten to so far. Even with all that I have learned theres still so much more left to learn. Im looking forward to growing in my knowledge and comfortablility with not just the React/Redux library but coding in general.
