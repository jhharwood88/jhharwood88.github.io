So far ive been enjoying my experience with coding, there are moments of clarity and moments of doubt where ive wondered if im actually understanding the material or just using inferences of materials provided to fill in the blanks. I feel much more sound and comfortable than where i was a month ago but realize that im still a good ways away from being truly proficient in Ruby. Im enjoying getting into the higher level problems as of recently, although they do tend to casue greater trepidation in taking them on when not feeling confident in my abilities. Ive found some similarities in everyday life, but more so realize how many of the things we use in day to day life while not inherently being programmed still follow similairly structured routines and operations. Im looking forward to the time when i can start implimenting my learning into solving real world problems of my own.
