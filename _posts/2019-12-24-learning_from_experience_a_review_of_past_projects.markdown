Looking back on my previous project blog posts, I can say one thing for certain and that is that I have come a long way from where I started and still have a long journey ahead of me. Looking back onto my first projects blog post, I see issues that were at the time large and imposing where as of now they would simply be interesting avenues to explore and express my current knowledge set and use my creativity to circumvent some of the issues that plagued those early projects. 

In particular, looking at the issues of not having a reasonable API to deal with when trying to accumulate data for the CLI project, now would not pose nearly as large of an issue as all of this data could be scraped and a rails API constructed to be able to supply a more user friendly and intuitive front end solution as opposed to a comand line based interface that is not only clunky, but would generally be outside of a uninitiated persons scope of ability. 

This learning experience, while great, leads me more into the future of where I will be headed on my journey as a newly emergent full stack developer. Its with a growth based mindset and a desire for knowledge and an eye for creativity I plan on taking these early stumbling blocks on and using them instead as jumping points to a better and more fluent knowledge of the languages involved as well as the procedures and practices that make them effective.
