After finishing my courses in the FlatIron curriculum, I was curious as to how and more specifically why we use test driven development to help guide us through the lessons. It wasn't until my first time building out my own project without a test suite that it started to dawn on me just how helpful TDD was in conjunction with building resilient and functional code.

Through my own studies after the course, I have spent some time learning more about how RSpec works, and how to even write my own unit tests to help insure that the code I am writing is performing as intended. It has been an interesting journey to see just how flexible yet specific you can write tests using the RSpec testing suite. Once gaining some experience writing tests it has become much easier to go back to previous lessons to read the tests and know exactly what and how they are checking my code against the provided examples. 

I have been able to use this newfound knowledge in my own projects, especially in situations where I am using a new gem or method im not quite as familiar with. It has helped immensely with narrowing down the cause of errors or incorrect responses from methods, as well as helping me to change the way I have been approaching a problem. No matter what language you are coding in, whether learning or keeping your knowledge fresh, I would highly recommend taking a dive into the testing suite specific to your language to glean a better understanding of the inner workings and connectedness of your code.
