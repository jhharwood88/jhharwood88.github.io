    I first began to learn coding early, starting with quick basic making word games and a basic math calculator. I spent a month or so messing around with VB and enjoyed the logic of programming but never had the drive to fully develop my knowledge of the language. After college i spent about 7 years working in kitchens beofre i looked back into coding. I took a month long bootcamp style web development course, I learned a good amount but didnt have the previous experience to be able to get the full benefit of the course. I spent the next two years pursuing a computer scinece degree through my local community college. I wasnt able to finish due to financial constraints forcing me to take a break and go back into multiple kitchen jobs to afford rent. Having to stop learning and being forced to go back into multiple jobs helped spur me into moving back to the east coast so that i could further pursue my education. I heard about flat iron through a family member who had workd with a company that had dev's that had gone through the program. After that i decided it was time to finish my education and enrolled in flat iron.
