For me when starting work with variables I found it difficult to see where i needed to use local variables versus instance or class variables. If your variable needs to be available only to the mehtod in which its being called its fine for it to be exclusive to that method but for the variable to be accessed by other methods or even other classes it must have scope outside of the method. This is important when you are working with multiple methods or classes that need to be able to see information from each other without inherently having the data local to the method.
