A linter is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. Linters were first used to check out the souce code, finding ways to optimize the code so that it could be compiled more efficently. Over the years, linters have evolved to include many other features and checks. Using linters have helped developers write code more efficently for non compiled languages. When writing in a non compiled language, linters can help to find typos, syntax errors, or uses of undeclared variables to name a few uses. This has helped developers fix and reduce the amount of bugs within their code.

Since their original inception, linters have become more and more complex. From their original beggings performing simple checks, they are now being used to perform more sophisticated tasks such as static analysis and checking for compicance with a given style guide. When being used for static analysis, the software will run through your code without actively executing it. This allows the linter to statically check for bugs, memory leaks, or any other check that may be helpful before actualy executing the code.

Linters can also be used as a way to help standardize your code base, useing specific guidelines to avoid having to make specific visual changes when making a pull request. This could be something as simple as supplementing tabs for spaces, or adding a line break after a certain amount of characters. This will allow a team to more purposefully focus on meaningfull decissions, such as possible bugs or other programatical issues rather than concentrating on stylistic changes.

Linters can be very helpful in making changes for security or best practice changes, such as checking for SQL injection voulnerabilites or when using similarly aligned functions such as = or == in Ruby. They can even be used to scan a codebase and actively replace these instances to help keep your code functioning as it should be.

All in all, Linters help to improve readability as well as removing common mistakes before execution or review of a given code base. This can help on multiple fronts, such as improving the analysis for code review, allowing the reviewer to focus more on the code rather than the aesthetic aspects that need to be changed. This allows coders to be more focused on solving bugs in their code, leading to more productivity and shorter delpoyment times on code!
